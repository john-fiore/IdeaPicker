# Idea Picker

Are you an indecisive person who doesn't know what to pick when you need to pick something? Well look no further!

Idea Picker is a simple application written in Python, where you simply input **two** options, and the bot will decide for you. It is written by me, John Fiore, a high-school Junior.

As of August 19, 2024, you can only input two options, but I will eventually program a feature that allows you to do more than that.

**WARNING: This has NOT been tested for Linux and MacOS!**

## How to use
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (needed)
2. Run the program\
   a. For Windows, run launc-windows.bat\
   b. For Linux/MacOS, run launch-lin-mac.sh
3. That's it
